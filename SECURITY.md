## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your help in maintaining the security of our project. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Contact Information**: Send an email to our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report".

2. **Provide Details**: In your report, please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected versions, a step-by-step explanation of how to reproduce the issue, and any relevant technical details. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and address the vulnerability.

3. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof-of-concept or a demonstration that showcases the vulnerability. This will assist us in understanding the issue more effectively.

4. **Your Contact Information**: Include your name and contact information in the report so that we can communicate with you regarding the vulnerability if needed. If you wish to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym, please let us know.

5. **Confidentiality**: We respect the importance of responsible disclosure. If you would like your name or any other identifying information to be kept confidential, please inform us in your report. We will maintain confidentiality unless required by law to disclose your information.

6. **Response Time**: Our security team will acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours and provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability. We will strive to keep you informed about our progress throughout the resolution process.

7. **Resolution and Disclosure**: Once we have verified and mitigated the vulnerability, we will take appropriate measures, such as releasing a security patch, providing a workaround, or implementing fixes. We aim to address the vulnerability in a timely manner and will notify you when the fix is available. We appreciate your patience during this process.

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to investigate and address it.

## Bug Bounty Program

To encourage and reward the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, we operate a bug bounty program. If you discover a qualifying vulnerability and abide by our responsible disclosure policy, you may be eligible for a monetary reward. Please visit our bug bounty program page at [example.com/bug-bounty](https://example.com/bug-bounty) for more information on eligibility, scope, and reward guidelines.

## Scope

Our security policy applies to the core functionality of our project, including the official releases and distributions. It does not cover vulnerabilities arising from custom modifications, unauthorized integrations, or third-party plugins.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe that responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities is essential to ensure the security and privacy of our users. We request that you:

- Make every effort to avoid impacting the privacy and availability of our users' data during your research.
- Refrain from accessing, modifying, or deleting data from our systems. If you encounter any sensitive information, please immediately halt your activities and notify us.
- Abide by all applicable laws and regulations throughout your security research.

We are committed to acknowledging and addressing vulnerabilities promptly and keeping you informed throughout

 the process. We appreciate your collaboration in helping us maintain a secure project.

Thank you for your contributions to our project's security.
